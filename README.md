# Culmination Bio Data Visualization/Front-end SWE Test

## Overview

Thank you for taking the time to apply to Culmination Bio as a Data Visualization/Front-end Software Engineer! Here you will find a starter for a data visualization project you are tasked with completing. This should not take you more than a few hours.

### Coffee Sales Data in Coffee Lake City
You are given day-by-day sales data over one week for a number of fictional coffee shops in Coffee Lake City. This can be found in `src/app/data/coffee.csv`. 

Your task is to 
1. Fork this repository.
2. Use `d3` to visualize this data. We've included an endpoint at `http://localhost:3000/api/data` to call the entire dataset, but feel free to add your own endpoints how you see fit.
3. Use CSS to style it however you'd like. Don't worry, we aren't testing your sense of style, just whether you can do it!
4. Make the data filterable- for help, we've included a text input component to use in `src/app/components/input.tsx`.
5. Make the data interactive, such as adding hover tooltips.
6. Feel free to modify any existing code how you need, and for bonus points, find areas of the code that you think need improvement and fix them.
7. Send it right back to us! You can modify the README to include any thoughts you had and justifications for choices you've made.
